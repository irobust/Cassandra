To setup your environment (on Mac & Windows)

	(1) Download VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/
	(2) Download Boot2Docker from http://boot2docker.io/

	(on Linux it should work if you just have the docker package installed)

To start up a Docker host on a Mac, run these commands:

	boot2docker --memory=4096 init
	boot2docker up
	$(boot2docker shellinit)
	boot2docker status

	The steps for Windows will be slightly different:
	https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/

To deploy a single Cassandra node to this docker host, run this command:

	docker run --name=n1 -d tobert/cassandra

You need the IP of this first container to pass as a parameter to subsequent
containers, so to find the IP address, run this command:

	docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' n1

To add a second node to the Cassandra cluster, run this command:

	docker run --name=n2 -d tobert/cassandra -seeds IP

	(where IP is the IP address you retrieved in the previous step)

To add a third node to the cluster, run a command similar to the last:

	docker run --name=n3 -d tobert/cassandra -seeds IP

	(where again the IP is the IP address retrieved previously)

At any time you can check the status of the cluster by running:

	docker exec -it n1 nodetool status

	(In fact, you can run it on any node:  n1, n2 or n3)

You can view the virtual node token allocations by running:

	docker exec -it n1 nodetool ring

You can log into one of the containers and view the configuration file with:

	docker exec -it n1 /bin/bash
	vi /data/conf/cassandra.yaml

When you're done, stop and remove the Cassandra containers with:

	docker stop n1 n2 n3
	docker rm n1 n2 n3

-----

To deploy a single Cassandra node, specifying a datacenter and rack:

	docker run --name n1 -d tobert/cassandra -dc DC1 -rack RAC1

To add a second node in a different rack:

	docker run --name n1 -d tobert/cassandra -dc DC1 -rack RAC2 -seeds IP

	(where IP is the IP address of the first node, retrieved via the same
	 process outlined above)

 To add a third node in a different datacenter:

 	docker run --name n3 -d tobert/cassandra -dc DC2 -rack RAC1 -seeds IP

 	(where again the IP is the IP address retrieved previously)

To view the configuration file where the datacenter and rack info is stored:

	docker exec -it n1 /bin/bash
	vi /data/conf/cassandra-rackdc.properties

You can run 'nodetool status' and 'nodetool ring' as before

When you're done, stop and remove the containers as before
